EESM5547 project 1

We've done 4 algorithms to compress the point cloud and they are:

1. DCT compression;
2. Random sampling compression;
3. Predictive coding compression;
4. Chord height error algorithm based on slicing.

The 4 algorithms are under the "algorithm" folder. I've maken the file name very readable you won't miss it.

4 .dat files out there are i put data. 

Two more .dat files will be generated each time you run the matlab program. We use them to calculate the compression ratio.

We compressed the 4 images in one single program for the first 3 algorithms;

But there are to many variables in the last algorithms, it's hard to separate them.

So we compress 4 images separately for the algorithm.
